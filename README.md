## Description

This mod aims to improve Minecraft's combat features. Although I added some features from the Java Combat update snapshots, 
the goal of this mod is not to copy exactly those features, and not all of them. Indeed, it's easier to rewrite Minecraft 
(as they do), than modifying its behavior with mods. Finally, I also add what I want so there are a few features from me. 
However, feel free to ask for new features in the comment section =)

- **Sword:** *don't kill my friends*
  * Sweeping edge active only with enchantment

- **Shield:** *get more magic*
  * Enchantable with the table: get unbreaking
  * Can add thorns and mending with anvil

- **Axe:** *how heavy*
  * Cooldown to use shield after attacking with axe
  * Cooldown to use axe after using shield

- **Bow:** *not a gun*
  * Power is less powerful, power 5 is the same as the old power 3
  * Either you get power to deal more damage, or you get punch/flame/infinity but not both

- **Crossbow:** *still not using it?*
  * Multishot can be used with piercing

- **Eat/Drink:** *ouch*
  * Eating/Drinking action is cancelled if attacked
  * Drink potions faster

- **Stacks:** *let's get some more*
  * Non-throwable potions can be stacked by 16
  * Milk buckets can be stacked by 16
  * Snow balls can be stacked by 64

- **Snow ball/egg:** *fight!*
  * If thrown by a player, hit and knockback players without damage
  * Knockback can be stopped with shield
